                <h3>TIGERS</h3>
                <p>Easily recognized by its coat of reddish-orange with dark stripes, the tiger is the largest wild cat in the world.
                    The big cat's tail is three feet long. On average the big cat weighs 450 pounds, about the same as eight ten-year-old kids.
                    It stands three feet tall with teeth four inches long and claws as long as house keys.</p>
                    <p>The powerful predator generally hunts alone, able to bring down prey such as deer and antelope. Tigers wait until dark to hunt.
                        The tiger sprints to an unsuspecting animal, usually pulling it off its feet with its teeth and claws. If the prey animal is large,
                        the tiger bites its throat to kill it; smaller prey is usually killed when the tiger breaks its neck. Tigers have been known to eat up to 80 pounds of meat in one night,
                        but more often they consume about 12 pounds during a meal. It may take days for a tiger to finish eating its kill. The cat eats until it's full, and then covers the carcass with leaves and dirt.
                        The tiger comes back to feed some more.Tigers can weigh up to 670 pounds.</p>
                        <strong><p>WHERE TO FIND THEM</p></strong>
                        <P>Tigers are found in a variety of habitats across Asia, primarily in India, Russia, and Southeast Asia,
                        including parts of China. They can be found in forests, grasslands, and even mangrove swamps. India is home to the largest population of wild tigers,
                        followed by Russia.
