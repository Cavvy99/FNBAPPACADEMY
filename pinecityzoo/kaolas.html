                <h3>KAOLAS</h3>
                <P>The koala is an iconic Australian animal.Often called the koala “bear,” this tree-climbing animal is a marsupial—a mammal with a pouch for the development of offspring.
                    Though koalas look fuzzy, their hair is more like the coarse wool of a sheep. 
                    They have two opposing thumbs on their hands, and both their feet and hands have rough pads and claws to grab onto branches.
                    They have two toes, fused together, on their feet, which they use to comb their fur.</P>
                    <p> It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round,fluffy ears and large, dark nose.
                    The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (8.8–33.1 lb). Its fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south.
                    These populations are possibly separate subspecies, but not all researchers accept this.</p>
                    <strong><p>WHERE TO FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>Koalas are found exclusively in Australia, primarily in the southeastern and eastern regions.
                    Their habitat is defined by the presence of eucalyptus trees, which they use for both food and shelter.</p>
