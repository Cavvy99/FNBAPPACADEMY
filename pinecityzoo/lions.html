                <h3>LIONS</h3>
                <P>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Sub-Saharan Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail.
                    It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane.
                    It is a social species,forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.
                    Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates.
                    The lion is an apex and keystone predator.</P>
                    <p> A full-grown male is about 1.8–2.1 metres (6–7 feet) long, excluding the 1-metre tail; he stands about 1.2 metres high at the shoulder and weighs 170–230 kg (370–500 pounds).
                        The female, or lioness, is smaller,with a body length of 1.5 metres, a shoulder height of 0.9–1.1 metres, and a weight of 120–180 kg.
                        The lion’s coat is short and varies in colour from buff yellow, orange-brown, or silvery gray to dark brown,
                        with a tuft on the tail tip that is usually darker than the rest of the coat.</p>
                        <strong><p>WHERE TO FIND THEM</p></strong>
                        <p>Lions are primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa, with smaller populations in India and West Africa.
                            They inhabit various habitats, including grasslands, savannas, dense scrub, and open woodlands.
                            In Africa, they are most abundant in East and Southern Africa, with significant populations in areas like the Serengeti and Masai Mara. </p>
