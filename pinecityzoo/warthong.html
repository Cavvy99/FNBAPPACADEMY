                <h3>WARTHONGS</h3>
                <p>These fierce-looking creatures can run fast.</p>
                <p>With four tusks and large shovel-shaped heads, warthogs look fierce, but they often avoid fighting predators such as lions, cheetahs, leopards, wild dogs, or hyenas by running away or dodging into a burrow.
                    Warthogs can run as fast as 30 miles (48 kilometers) an hour, often outdistancing a pursuer.
                    When cornered by predators, warthogs will attack with their sharp lower tusks, which can measure 6 inches (15 centimeters) long.
                    Older warthogs have long curved upper tusks that can grow as long as 2 feet (61 centimeters). Warthogs are generally peaceful,
                    but sometimes a male may attack another male during mating season.</p>
                    <strong><p>WHERE TO FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <P>Warthogs primarily inhabit open areas in sub-Saharan Africa, specifically grasslands, savannas, and woodlands.
                        They avoid dense forests, rainforests, and very dry desert areas, preferring open spaces with good access to food and shelter.
                        Warthogs often use abandoned burrows, like those of aardvarks,for shelter and raising young. </P>
